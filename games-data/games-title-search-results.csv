194089,2903,Warframe,"They were called Tenno. Warriors of blade and gun: masters of the Warframe armor. Those that survived the old war were left drifting among the ruins. Now they are needed once more.

The Grineer, with their vast armies, are spreading throughout the solar system. A call echoes across the stars summoning the Tenno to an ancient place. They summon you.

Allow the Lotus to guide you. She has rescued you from your cryostasis chamber and given you a chance to survive. The Grineer will find you; you must be prepared. The Lotus will teach you the ways of the Warframes and the secrets to unlocking their powers.

Come Tenno, you must join the war.",2013-03-25 00:00:00.000,94,NULL,73.4545,13,76.2323,248

Take missions from the Ostrons to fight Grineer during the day and clear out their bases, but be fast, as these Grineer will call reinforcements when they spot danger. As you venture deeper into the Plains the Grineer enemies will get progressively stronger, so come prepared.

When night falls on the Plains, towering Spectral Sentients known as Eidolons ascend from the waters and wander in search of all theyâ€™ve lost. Small, deadly Sentient drones appear throughout the Plains to protect the Eidolons. Many Grineer will retreat to their camps in fear of the Eidolons and attempt to wait out the night.
Gather your fellow Tenno. You'll need to work together to take down these massive creatures. Only the greatest Eidolon Hunters that combine forces will reign victorious.",2017-10-12 00:00:00.000,5,1,75.0000,1,89.8781,5
